## Create Room: 
Once you click on 'Create a Room', you will have the option to choose your desired room dimension ('Square', 'Rectangle', 'Custom Room'). Square (11 ft by 11 ft) and Rectangle (~16 ft by 11 ft) are some default room options if you don't want to put any dimensions yet. The Custom Room will create a drop down menu for you to input the dimensions of the room you desire in feet. Once you click 'Create!', a room with your dimensions will appear.

## Room Pages
Each room layout has a sidebar menu with many different room items, categorized by room type. Click on the item you would like to be added to your room. This would expand and show the users the rotated options for the furniture and clicking on it will make it appear in the room. When dragging the furniture around the room, lines with the distance from the furniture to the all four walls will appear to make it easier to determine where you would like to place the furniture. After arranging the room to your desire, click on the camera icon on the bottom right corner to take a screenshot, which will be stored for you to view in the View Previous Rooms tab. If you want to delete one or many furnitures, click on the red trashcan above the camera and an _x_ will appear on all the furnitures. Simply press the _x_ on whatever furnitures you would like to delete.
