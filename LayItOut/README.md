# Welcome to my Homwork 4 Part B ðŸ‘‹


## Get started

1. In branch if have not used fonts, run:
2. 
   ```bash
   expo install expo-font
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

### Topic: Design 

Made adjustments to the following: 
- Changed font of text to a more blocky fun font. 
- Made buttons more round and uniform.
- Displayed dimensions on the side of the rooms within room pages of Square Room and Rectangle Room.

A good look at the starting poit is the branch: bw-uiChanges   

*Note: The gridlines on rooms are partially implemented here, but were not decided to keep, so just ignore them.
