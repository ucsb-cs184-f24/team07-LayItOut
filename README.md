# Team07 - Room Layout App

Our team is working toward creating a layout planner app that helps with visualizing a given room. The layout planner will help the user in planning out a design for a room given measurements, making sure it fits in the room as well as help visualize what the spacing of the room will look like after. This can be done through 2D rendering of objects using information given by the user.
