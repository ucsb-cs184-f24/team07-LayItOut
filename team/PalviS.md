### Team Introductions

Team Member: Palvi Sabherwal

Hello! My name is Palvi Sabherwal and I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science major. Last winter I took CS148 where I worked on a group project to develop Blindy, a blind dating app. Working on this React web app allowed me to improve my skills in Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
