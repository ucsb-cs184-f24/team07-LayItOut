# Team Introductions

Team Member: Hannah Shakouri

Hi my name is Hannah, I'm a fourth year Computer Science major. I took CS185 last winter, where I gained knowledge about ux/ui design and how to use figma. I also took CS156 last Spring, I worked on GauchoRide Web app that provide transportation for UCSB students. From this project I gained experience with React Native and JavaScript working on both the backend and frontend.
