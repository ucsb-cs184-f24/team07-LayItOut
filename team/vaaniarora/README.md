# Process/Documentation
###### by Vaani Arora for HW4

The Starting Point of my Process/Documentation was already quite robust as we had already had documentation for all the meetings we conducted.
What I wanted to contribute is a more robust documentation of the meetings, specifying who completed what and who is working on what issue as 
well as any decisions we made and the merges we did in that meeting.

My documentation began in Sprint03 and all those team meeting documentation contains the above goals. I also created the Design.md and Manual.md
docs for the final. I created a user flow diagram for the Design.md document.
