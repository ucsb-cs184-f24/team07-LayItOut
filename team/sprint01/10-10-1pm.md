_Scribed Discussion:_

Palvi is absent for work, but she notified us via slack.

5/7 people are done with homework 01, but are close to completion. Today, we just checked that everything for Sec01 is in order
and completed. We began to map out the app layout to come up with tasks to put in our kanban board.

Ideas:
- Login (Portrait)
- Room Options (Portrait)
    - Create room and previous saved rooms
- Room Layout (Landscape)
    - Start as blocks for furniture, but then add images of the furniture over it later

Questions
- How do we store this data for the user?
- Is it required to log in to the app?
