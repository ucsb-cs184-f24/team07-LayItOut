# HW04: Implementation Contribution

### Starting Point Branch

### Final Result Branch

### Overall Structure
In 'Login.tsx', I added testID's so that I could test the login functionality. Then I created a tests folder that holds 'Login.test.js'. In this file, there are 4 tests that go over different elements of the login, including logging in with email and password and checking the alerts. ChatGPT helped me when I ran into errors and things like that.
