# HW04: Design Contribution

### Starting Point
This branch shows my starting point: bw-uiChanges 
- here, I had implemented the gridlines, but not the display layout and font & button changes.

To describe the starting point, for the font/buttons, we see it on all of the pages (splash, Login, home, create, square, rectangle, custom) with their font and buttons. 
For the display dimensions, we see it on the pages Square and Rectangle, there is no display of the room dimensions along the sides.

### Final Result Branch

### Overall Structure
In the branch, you can find the files I edited for the Homework. 
For font/button changes, I edited: SplashPage, HomePage, Login, CreatePage, RectangleRoom, SquareRoom, CustomRoom.
I loaded the custom font onto each page, and then added font in the StyleSheet where relavant. I got the font from google and downloaded the zip file. I added the files to assets folder, and installed fonts with:
- expo install expo-font
For the display dimensions, I edited: SquareRoom and RectangleRoom.
I added text to the display and set it to display outside of the room dimensions, and rotated the Height dimension.
