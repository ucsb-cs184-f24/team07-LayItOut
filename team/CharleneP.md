### Team Introductions

Team Member: Charlene Patenaude

Hello! My name is Charlene Patenaude and I am currently a fourth-year with a double major in Computer Science and Communications. I also have a double minor in Statistics and Applied Psychology. Last Spring I completed my first project classes. I worked on Happy Cows in CS156 and a VR bowling game in CS190I. From these projects, I gained experience with react and javascript as well as C# and working in Unity.
