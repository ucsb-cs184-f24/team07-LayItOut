# App Idea

Our team is working toward creating a layout planner app that helps with visualizing a given room. The layout planner will help the user in planning out a design for a room given 
measurements, making sure it fits in the room as well as help visualize what the spacing of the room will look like after. This can be done through 3D rendering of objects using 
information given by the user.

# Problem Scenario
Moving into a new space and not sure if all your furniture will fit or where to put it? Luckily, you just downloaded the new Layout app that allows you to enter dimensions and visualize your interior design. Our app also helps you to remodel your room before enlisting your friends to move your furniture.

User: Jenny Wright
Jenny is moving into a new apartment for graduate school after living in her current apartment for 3 years. She has accumulated a lot of funiture and decorations that hold a lot of value to her and she would like to fit into her new smaller apartment. Jenny has the dimensions of the apartment from the listing online. She decides to download the new Layout app she heard about from her friend. 
Using this app she is able to visualize where she can put her old furniture in teh new space and multiple possible configurations for her to choose from. Jenny feels a lot less stressed out about her move and is able to pack up her apartment with confidence.
