# App Idea

Our team is working toward creating a layout planner app that helps with visualizing a given room. The layout planner will help the user in planning out a design for a room given 
measurements, making sure it fits in the room as well as help visualize what the spacing of the room will look like after. This can be done through 3D rendering of objects using 
information given by the user.

# Problem Scenario
Moving into a new space and not sure if all your furniture will fit or where to put it? Luckily, you just downloaded the new Layout app that allows you to enter dimensions 
and visualize your interior design. Our app also helps you to remodel your room before enlisting your friends to move your furniture.
