# Team Introductions

Team Member: Bella Ward

Hi! My name is Bella Ward and I am a 4th year Computer Science major. I took CS156 last Fall and worked on a group project Last winter for a web app that manages github for programming and software engineering courses. Through this project I gained experience with JavaScript and React Native working both backend and frontend.
