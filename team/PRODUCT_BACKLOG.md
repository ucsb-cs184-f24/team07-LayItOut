# Product Backlog

- As a user my experience would be better if the orientation changed to horizontal after logging in.
- As a user it would be more applicable if I could enter custom room sizes.
- As a user it would be more convenient to have to have the furniture icons permanently on the page rather than it popping out to use the space better.
- As a user it would be more UI friendly for me to pick the color of the blueprint color with a grid.
- As a user it is quite unituitive to be able to place the furniture outside the blueprint boundary.
- As a user it would be useful to be able to remove and rotate the furniture.
