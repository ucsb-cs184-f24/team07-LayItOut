# HW04: Implementation Contribution

### Starting Point Branch
https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f24/team07-LayItOut/tree/ps-previousLayout
### Final Result Branch
https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f24/team07-LayItOut/tree/ps-prevLayPage
### Overall Structure
My experiment can be seen through the ps-prevLayPage branch, where I modified the file 'PreviousRooms.tsx'. In this file, I retrieved the saved screenshots from our app's Firebase Storage and displayed it like a photo gallery. I also added a few features to each image to allow the user to click on their previous layout and view it in fullscreen mode, as well as the option to delete their past project they no longer want to keep saved.

****Visuals:**** The image 'before_visual.png' shows how the page looked before I worked on my experiment. The image 'after_visual1'.png shows how the page looks like now, after I worked on retrieving images from Firebase Storage. The image 'after_visual2.png' shows how the user can click on each image to view in fullscreen mode and delete it if they no longer want it saved.
