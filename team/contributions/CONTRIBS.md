In our team project, I managed the Firebase storage, implemented the delete furniture feature, added the screenshot feature, and worked on the 'View Previous Rooms' page. For the Firebase storage, I worked on saving and retrieving the room layout images (taken by the User via the screenshot button on each layout page). The room layout images are displayed on the 'View Previous Rooms' page, where the user can view it in fullscreen mode and delete the projects they no longer wish to save (images are also deleted from the Firebase). I also added a delete furniture feature to each room page, where the user can remove furniture pieces from their layout. For most of the quarter, I acted as 'Scrum Master' and was mainly responsible for documenting our team's progress and section deliverables (which explains the large number of commits in our git repo).
