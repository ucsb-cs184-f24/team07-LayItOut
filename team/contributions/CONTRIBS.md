In our team project, I managed the Firebase storage, implemented the delete furniture feature, added the screenshot feature, and worked on the 'View Previous Rooms' page. For the Firebase storage, I worked on saving and retrieving the room layout images (taken by the User via the screenshot button on each layout page). The room layout images are displayed on the 'View Previous Rooms' page, where the user can view it in fullscreen mode and delete the projects they no longer wish to save (images are also deleted from the Firebase). I also added a delete furniture feature to each room page, where the user can remove furniture pieces from their layout. For most of the quarter, I acted as 'Scrum Master' and was mainly responsible for documenting our team's progress and section deliverables (which explains the large number of commits in our git repo).

For out project, I worked mainly on coding the starting implementation of the Create Room page, the Square Room page, the Rectangle Room page, and the LongRectangle Room page (later turned into Custom Room). For Create Room, I added the agreed upon background image, the title of text for the page and the buttons to choose the different room options. For Square Room I added a room object of fixed square size to the page. For the Rectangle Room and Long Rectangle Room I added a room object of fixed rectangular size to the page.
I also worked on design / UI of the whole project. For this I made all of the buttons and dropdowns have appearingly uniform shape and size. I also added a new unique font for all pages. I adjusted the size and font for all text across all pages to have an appearingly uniform font and size. This included editing the Splash page, Login page, Create Room page, Square Room page, Rectangle Room page, and Custom Room page. I also added implementation to display for the height and width of the size of the room on the Square Room page and Rectangle Room page.
